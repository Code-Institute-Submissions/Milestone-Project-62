experience the entire platform for ease of use.

## Design Decisions
The design follows a minimalistic approach by only displaying content that is of value to the visitor, 
and keeping any overflow out of the design process, relying heavily on dynamic user content.
The happy bun takes much inspiration from [Tine mat](https://www.tine.no/oppskrifter).
